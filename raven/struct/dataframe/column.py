class Column(ABC):
    """A labeled Column to be used in a DataFrame.

    Each Column is a container for data of a specific type. Although it can be
    constructed and initialized independently, a Column is always managed by a
    DataFrame instance.

    A concrete Column can only use data of one specific type.
    This abstract class defines methods all Columns to be used in DataFrames
    must implement. Additonal methods may be provided by concrete
    implementations.

    Concrete Columns can be differentiated either by their underlying class
    or by their unique type code. The type code is exposed as a public
    constant by each implementing class. Additionally, the type_code() member
    method, which must be implemented by all concrete Columns, gives
    dynamic access to the type code of a Column instance at runtime. For a
    more human readable indication, the type_name() method returns a
    string denoting the type of the elements which can be stored by the
    corresponding Column. The type name is the same for default and
    nullable columns which work with the same element type while the type
    code is always unique across all Column classes.

    Generally, there are two main groups of columns. Those that accept null
    values and those that do not. Regardless of this differentiation, all
    concrete Columns must extend this abstract base class. The term 'null'
    or 'null value' is equivalent to the term 'None' and 'NoneType' and
    may be used interchangeably.

    Each Column can have a distinct label associated with it. That label
    represents the name of that Column by which it can be referenced and
    accessed when it is being used inside a DataFrame.

    Even though users can get and set values inside Columns directly through
    the get_value() and set_value() methods defined by the Column class,
    it is generally recommended to always perform operations regarding Columns
    by using the appropriate methods of the DataFrame that the Column is
    part of. With the exception of Column construction, generally, working
    with Column instances directly is regarded as more lower-level compared to
    using the public DataFrame API to manipulate Columns. As a consequence,
    concrete Column implementations can raise exceptions other
    than DataFrameException, for example ValueError when an invalid
    argument is passed to a method of a Column.

    Columns do not distinguish between their size and their capacity.
    The row count size is always managed by a DataFrame and any required
    resizing is also explicitly precipitated by it. Therefore, the value
    returned by the capacity() method always indicates the true length of
    the array used internally to store the Column values. However, this may
    include any buffered space allocated by a DataFrame in order make its
    operations more efficient. This has to be taken into account when a
    user works with data in Columns directly.

    This class provides various static methods to construct concrete
    Column instances.

    Every Column is cloneable by means of the clone() method.
